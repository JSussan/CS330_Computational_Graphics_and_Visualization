# CS330_Computational_Graphics_and_Visualization
Create realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries and best practices.

# How do I approach designing software?
While I believe that modern OpenGL is very complicated to learn in an eight week course, I did learn a lot. While I was challenged at creating certain 3D shapes, I did fairly well in other aspects such as camera movement, applying textures, and lighting my scene. These new aspects I learned were quite fascinating and I did not previously understand how to incorporate those. This course also reaffirrmed how important it is to keep projects well organized and commented.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs first by defining the problem. Once the problem is defined, I start conducting research and brainstorming. Next, I would create a prototype, followed by tests to make sure everything is working as intended. Then I go back to my code and see if there are any improvements I can make. The way the weekly assignments were structured, by introducing a new element each week was very helpful. One week were working on 2D shapes, another week on input devices, camera movement, textures, etc. It helps learning in a structured way.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The experience I have gained throughout this course with computational graphics and visualizations will go a long way in the future of my educational pathway. I learned how important it is to be organized and write well commented code when creating software.
